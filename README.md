# Caesar-Cipher
In encryption or decryption method Caesar Cipher is very common technique to encrypt data.
I have made this code with proper Caesar Cipher or Shift Cipher algorithm using C programming language.
There are some limitation of this code you could not able to do encrypt any number. This code is only working English alphabet.
You can make fun with your friends to encrypt any sentence and send them to decrypt.
If you have any query feel free to ask me.
